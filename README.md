# Brian's favorite things in Vegas

This guide is from knowledge from mid-90s to the last trip I took in 2015. Lots has changed, I'm sure. I fact checked most of this and it is still relevant. No warrany expressed or implied! If y'all ignore this list completely no hard feelings at all! Have a great time and find your own favorite things. 

## Hotels & Casinos (just to hang out in)

__Cosmopolitian.__ Favorite place in Vegas to stay and eat. 


## Activities

__Walk the strip!__ My favorite is to start from the Luxor (Mandalay if you are ambitious) then head north to Caesars Palace (Treasure Island), hitting every hotel casino in between... staying on the west side. Then, another day, do the east side from MGM Grand to the Wynn.

__Go downtown.__ Fremont street. This is closer to the "original" 1950's Elvis Vegas. The "Fremont Street Experience" is a lightshow that is quaint compared to "The Sphere" and predates it by 20 years. Free concerts I think with some top bands. We missed "Presidents of the United States" by a day.

__Luxor Pyramid.__  Luxor was going downhill for years before COVID it seemed, but the inside of the pyramid is crazy cool. See if you can sneak onto one of the "inclinators" and ride to a top floor.

__New York, New York rollercoster.__ Totally cheezy. I think totally worth it. The arcade at the entrance to the coaster is fun also.

__Bellagio Fountain__. Iconic and a wild feat of engineering.

__Caesar's Palace Forum Shops and Venitian Grand Canal Shoppes.__ Both are comparable and awesome. Have lunch or dinner at one of the restaurants on the canal. And watch the sunset on the fake sky ceiling. It is delightful.

__Stratosphere observation deck and "Big Shot" at night.__ You'll need an Uber, but it is fun. The Big Shot at night is scary and thrilling. This place was also getting kindof sketchy years ago, but still worth it.

## Places to chill



## Gambling




## Pools


## Nightlife


## Shows

__Any Cirque du Soleil show.__ Myst√®re is the OG show that has been running for decades, but a great show all the same. "O" is the 2nd oldest. You might have best luck with those. I used to get "rush" tickets an hour before the show at the box office for either at like 50% off... don't know they do that any more.

Live music in casinos... from single piano lounge singers to full rock bands. I'd always just stumble across them.

## Errata

I truly think Vegas is meant to be experienced half-drunk from breakfast until bedtime... with a good nap in the afternoon (preferably by the pool). Start on the plane there, a marg in the cab outta the airport and don't stop until you are back at DIA. It is total and complete sensory overload and this is the only way I think a normal person can adapt.
