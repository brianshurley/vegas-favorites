# Brian's favorite things in Vegas

This guide is from knowledge from mid-90s to the last trip I took in 2015. Lots has changed, I'm sure. I fact checked most of this and it is still relevant. No warrany expressed or implied! If y'all ignore this list completely no hard feelings at all! Have a great time and find your own favorite things. 

## Hotels & Casinos (just to hang out in)

__Cosmopolitian.__ Favorite place in Vegas to stay and eat. 

__Bellagio.__ The Dale Chihuly glass ceiling is an amazing work of art. The conservatory is one of the coolest indoor botanical things I've see (and I've seen a lot). There is walk-up coffee shop/breakfast place that has the best muesli (think cold overnight oatmeal) anywhere. I hear they also serve it in their breakfast buffet.

__MGM Grand.__ Yes it is kindof "Disney" feeling but you seriously can get off the plane, stay at the Grand for 3 days and never leave and have a great trip. It is massive. Walking distance for y'all... might be a fun half day. Also good table games if I recall. Good nightclub. Good restaurants. Awesome pool complex. 

## Activities

__Walk the strip!__ My favorite is to start from the Luxor (Mandalay if you are ambitious) then head north to Caesars Palace (Treasure Island if you are ambitious), hitting every hotel casino in between... staying on the west side. Then, another day, do the east side from MGM Grand to the Wynn.

__Go downtown.__ Fremont street. This is closer to the "original" 1950's Elvis Vegas. The "Fremont Street Experience" is a lightshow that is quaint compared to "The Sphere" and predates it by 20 years. Free concerts I think with some top bands. We missed "Presidents of the United States" by a day.

__Luxor Pyramid.__  Luxor was going downhill for years before COVID it seemed, but the inside of the pyramid is crazy cool. See if you can sneak onto one of the "inclinators" and ride to a top floor.

__New York, New York rollercoster.__ Totally cheezy. I think totally worth it. The arcade at the entrance to the coaster is fun also.

__Bellagio Fountain__. Iconic and a wild feat of engineering.

__Caesar's Palace Forum Shops and Venitian Grand Canal Shoppes.__ Both are comparable and awesome. Have lunch or dinner at one of the restaurants on the canal. And watch the sunset on the fake sky ceiling. It is delightful.

__Stratosphere observation deck and "Big Shot" at night.__ You'll need an Uber, but it is fun. The Big Shot at night is scary and thrilling. This place was also getting kindof sketchy years ago, but still worth it.

__Carnival Court bar__. Next to Harrah's on the strip. Trick bartenders that are amazing to watch. They employ some world-champion "flair" bartenders (at least they did years ago). Outside. Always a DJ or live band. 

## Food

I never took notes. All of Vegas is a foodie Mecca. The Japanese restaurant at the Cosmo. The Mexican-Chinese restaurant at the Cosmo. The buffet at the Cosmo. 

The Italian restaurant in the Canal Shoppes. 

All of my favorite old-school dive places appear to have closed. There was a cafe downstairs at Binions that had a $8 prime rib starting at 11pm that just felt like "old" Vegas you see in the movies.


## Places to chill

TODO - that cool penny/nickel slot place next to Venetian
The benches on the strip by the Bellagio fountain (but grand prix has probably screwed that)
Any sports book / horse racing lounge at any casino. They are quiet, (usually) clean, and you can bet very little and drink free.


## Gambling

TODO

* Table games at Hard Rock were fun... but that is in flux with the move. 
* Planet Hollywood I remember being a lot of fun... blackjack, pai gow poker, roulette.
* Craps at Cosmo were expensive but great group of people.
* MGM Grand is solid (but expensive)
* Go downtown and gamble to find best odds and games.


## Pools

MGM Grand for just fun low-key day at the pool. Cosmopolitian for stylish "day clubbing". Both probably have day passes (you don't have to stay there).


## Nightlife

I always was chaperoned by people who knew what was up. No clue. I remember the club at the Cosmo that extended out to by the pool being fun.


## Shows

__Any Cirque du Soleil show.__ Myst√®re is the OG show that has been running for decades, but a great show all the same. "O" is the 2nd oldest. You might have best luck with those. I used to get "rush" tickets an hour before the show at the box office for either at like 50% off... don't know they do that any more.

Live music in casinos... from single piano lounge singers to full rock bands. I'd always just stumble across them.

## Outside

__Hoover Dam.__ Take the upgraded tour. It really is the best dam tour around.

__Kayaking the Colorado.__ Just downstream of Hoover Dam is a strech of river that is stunning and you can find outfitters to drop you off and pick you up a few miles downstream (takes about 6 hours if I recall). Hot springs everywhere along the way... pretty little creeks flowing into the river and you realize they are 160 degrees. Owls and birds or prey nesting. Beautiful canyons.

__Red Rock Canyon.__ Just scramble/hike on the iconic rocks. Icebox Canyon is a great hike... get there early if it is hot.


## Supporting materials

* You have to watch the movie adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" with Johnny Depp. If you like it read the book.  
* Frank Sinatra. [The Rat Pack: Live At The Sands 1963 (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCvLddZFjzg) or any other live Rat Pack recordings
* Wayne Newton, Liberace, Tom Jones 
* Tons of Vegas documentaries out there...
* MIT Blackjack team ... "Bringing Down the House" is facinating. Haven't read the book or seen the movie but know the story. My dad was a skilled card counter (and lost his ass every time in Vegas).
* "Mars Attacks" movie (I love the Vegas parts of this :-) 

## Errata

I truly think Vegas is meant to be experienced half-drunk from breakfast until bedtime... with a good nap in the afternoon. Start on the plane there, a marg in the cab outta the airport and don't stop until you are back at DIA. It is total and complete sensory overload and this is the only way I think a normal person can adapt.
